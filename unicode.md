This list (so far)  is mechanically generated merging all errors
messages from linux and windows.

Latter we need to manually check the meaning to see if two or more messages
are diferent but have the same meaning. In this case they must be merged.

Each table from windows or linux or lib or protocol will receive a page code name
and we be able to convert from and to this table. (Also just like unicode does for chars)
